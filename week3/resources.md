## Generative AI Lifecycle
1. (Generative AI on AWS: Building Context-Aware, Multimodal Reasoning Applications)[https://www.amazon.com/Generative-AI-AWS-Multimodal-Applications/dp/1098159225/] - This O'Reilly book dives deep into all phases of the generative AI lifecycle including model selection, fine-tuning, adapting, evaluation, deployment, and runtime optimizations.


## Reinforcement Learning from Human-Feedback (RLHF)
1. (Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.02155.pdf] - Paper by OpenAI introducing a human-in-the-loop process to create a model that is better at following instructions (InstructGPT).

2. (Learning to summarize from human feedback)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01325.pdf] - This paper presents a method for improving language model-generated summaries using a reward-based approach, surpassing human reference summaries.

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
1. (Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf] - The paper from researchers at OpenAI that first proposed the PPO algorithm. The paper discusses the performance of the algorithm on a number of benchmark tasks including robotic locomotion and game play.

2. (Direct Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Reward Model)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18290.pdf] - This paper presents a simpler and effective method for precise control of large-scale unsupervised language models by aligning them with human preferences.

## Scaling human feedback
1. (Constitutional AI)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf]: Harmlessness from AI Feedback - This paper introduces a method for training a harmless AI assistant without human labels, allowing better control of AI behavior with minimal human input.

## Advanced Prompting Techniques
1. (Chain-of-thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf] - Paper by researchers at Google exploring how chain-of-thought prompting improves the ability of LLMs to perform complex reasoning.

2. (PAL: Program-aided Language Models)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10435] - This paper proposes an approach that uses the LLM to read natural language problems and generate programs as the intermediate reasoning steps.

3. (ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629] - This paper presents an advanced prompting technique that allows an LLM to make decisions about how to interact with external applications.

## LLM powered application architectures
1. (LangChain Library (GitHub))[https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain] - This library is aimed at assisting in the development of those types of applications, such as Question Answering, Chatbots and other Agents. You can read the documentation here.

2. (Who Owns the Generative AI Platform?)[https://a16z.com/2023/01/19/who-owns-the-generative-ai-platform/] - The article examines the market dynamics and business models of generative AI.
